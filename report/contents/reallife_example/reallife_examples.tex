        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Heavy Initialization:} Lower Initialization costs, as cloning faster than than building a new object from scratch

            \item \textbf{Heavy Initialization:} Lower Initialization costs, as cloning faster than than building a new object from scratch
            \item \textbf{Subclass Explosion:} Helpful for managing various objects with minor differences. Instead of creating multiple classes, you can clone and modify prototypes.

            \item \textbf{Dynamic Configurations:} If you need to create objects at runtime, you can \code{clone} a base configuration and adjust it as necessary. \cite{faraz_prototype_proscons}
